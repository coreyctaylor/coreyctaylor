                HTML5 fixed issues that were problematic in the previous versions of the program.<br>
                Below are tags and features that they added to HTML5: <br>
                < section> This tag allows the user to define section of the web page. <br>
                  < header> This tag allows the user to add a header for the web page. <br>
                    < footer> This tag allows the user to define the footer the webpage. <br>
                      < nav> This tag defines navigation links. <br>
                        < article> This tag allows the user to illustrate and focus on the primary idea of the
                          website.<br>
                          < aside> This tag allows the user to add things to the side of the page as a sidebar.
                            <br>
                            < figure> This tag allows the user to use a image reference in the main and subpart
                              of the webpage. <br>

                <li>Java Applets:</li> <BR>
                A <bold> java applet </bold> is defined as a program functioning to embedding into a HTML document,
                transferred over the web, and runs inside a browser. Applets are secure and can be ran on multiple
                platforms. Applets are
                secure in which applets have restrictions. For an example, they cant not go through personal documents
                and files.
                Applets are used to view webpages. Browsers have interpreters built in to execute applets.
                If want to interact with an applet you can find them online. They are useful but they will not
                complete all your needs.

                <li>Java Server Pages:</li> <BR>
                A Java Server Page (JSP) is a web page that had JSP scriptlets embedded into it. A JSP scriptlet is a
                portion of code embedded in a HTML document designed to dynamically contribute to the content of the web
                page. JSP code isn't the exact same as Java, but it resembles the general Java programming language.
                JSPs are executed on the server side, where the web page resides. JSPs help dynamically define the
                content of a web page before it is shipped to the user. Once it reaches your computer, all active
                processing has already taken place, producing a static web page (delivered to the user exactly as it was
                stored). JSPs are particularly good for coordinating the interaction between a web page and the
                underlying database. Electronic storefronts ( sites that exist to sell products) make extensisve use of
                this type of processing. The data about available products isn’t stored on static HTML pages, but rather
                inside the database.

                    <li> XML: </li> <BR>
                    The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a language that allows the user to describe the content of a
                    document. XML is a metalanguage. We use metalanguages in order to define other languages. Think of
                    it like an English grammar book describing the rules of English. Tim berners-Lee used a metalanguage
                    called “Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) to define Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
                    However, XML is a simplified version of SGML and is used to define other markup languages. XML does
                    not replace HTML, XML enhances HTML. Similar to HTML, XML is made up of tagged data. However, XML
                    isn’t bound to restrictions of predefined tags. With XML, you can create your own tags to describe
                    the data in your document. The first line of a document indicates the version of XML being used. The
                    second line indicates the file that contains the Document Type Definition (DTD). The DTD is the
                    specification of the organization of an XML document. XML provides a standard format for organizing
                    data without tying it to any particular type of output. A similar technology called Extensible
                    Stylesheet Language (XSL) allows the user to transform an XML document into a format more suitable
                    for them.

                        <li> Social Networks: </li> <BR>
                        In this day and age, many people’s life on the web involves heavy use of social networks to keep
                        in touch with friends, family, colleagues, and even people they do not personally know. What is
                        a social network you ask? Well by standard definition, a social network is an online service
                        that allows people with shared interests to communicate and interact. The function of a social
                        network is to facilitate communication so users are able to share their ideas, interests, and
                        even events they plan. Some of the most popular social networks out right now are; Facebook,
                        Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Google+, Instagram, and Tumblr. Facebook was created by Mark
                        Zuckerberg at Harvard University in 2004.Facebook is currently the most popular social
                        networking site. Online social networks tend to allow users to be classified in either internal,
                        where participants are within a private community, or external, where there are no restrictions
                        on who is allowed in. The concept of a social network has been around way longer than the online
                        version we have now. In face, the concept of social networks are the backbone of serious
                        sociological research. Think of a social network as a model of how individuals or organizations
                        interact. Research into social networks began as early in the 1800s. Networks have been used to
                        model interactions such as the spread of new ideas, the spread of diseases, and the formation of
                        emotional clusters. One study observed how happiness correlated with social networks. For
                        example, if one person is happy, then their nearby friends have a twenty five percent higher
                        chance of being happy as well. The impact of social networks cannot be understated, especially
                        with how many lives it influences.
